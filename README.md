Room booking and availability tracking.
Customer check-in and check-out processes.
Bill generation and payment management.
Room status updates (occupied, vacant, or under maintenance).
Implemented features such as file handling for storing and retrieving customer data, menu-driven interface for ease of use.This project demonstrates proficiency in object-oriented programming, file management, and algorithm design in C++.
